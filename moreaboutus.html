            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>BioInfo is committed to revolutionizing bioinformatics by creating tools that enable researchers to better understand DNA sequences. Whether it’s analyzing SNPs to predict diseases or exploring STR expansions for genetic insights, our goal is to simplify complex processes for scientists worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Key Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Defining and Analyzing SNPs:</strong>
                    SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are small but significant DNA variations. Our tools make it easy to reference, classify, and study these variations using their "rs" identifier (e.g., <code>rs3761548</code>). This helps highlight key genetic traits or potential medical risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding STRs:</strong>
                    Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are repetitive sequences that can affect genetic stability. Tracking excessive STR expansions is crucial for diagnosing conditions like Huntington's Disease and Fragile X Syndrome, and BioInfo simplifies this process with its repeat analysis feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Impact:</strong>
                    While rare, diseases caused by genetic variations impact millions globally. For example, Huntington's Disease affects roughly 2.7 per 100,000 people worldwide. With BioInfo, researchers can better analyze the genetic markers linked to such conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Streamlined DNA Analysis:</strong>
                    Our programming language, Bionto, optimizes DNA data handling with simple syntax and powerful features. Tasks like counting STR repeats, analyzing SNPs, and complementary base pairing become more accessible.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetic Anticipation:</strong>
                    BioInfo includes tools to track intergenerational changes like repeat expansions that cause diseases to worsen over generations—critical for studying genetic inheritance patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
